description: Hi there! I am a postdoctoral researcher at the Department of Computer Science of the University of Luxembourg. My research lies at knowledge representation and reasoning, especially on common sense reasoning using tools like formal argumentation and non-monotonic logics. I am also interested in exploring different parts of computational AI argumentation, dialogue technology, AI ethics, etc., and also how these diverse domains interact and inform each other.
